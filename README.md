In dataset 2( Production_of_Agriculture_Stock-Ministry_of_Finance) I am calculating monthly changes in stock levels for each food grain type and creating a line chart for each grain type to visualize the changes over time.
In dataset 1 (MergerdAyush_Colleges_in_India_01-04-2021_0) I have created a stacked bar chart and a line chart showing the number of Ayush colleges in each state or union territory, grouped by type of system (government or non-government). 
In dataset 3(Road_Transport_BRS_2017-18_Annexure7_9c). To visualize the distribution of National, State, and District roads for each state, I am using a stacked bar chart and line chart.
